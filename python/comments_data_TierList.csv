After all, disk space for new content is the reason why they remove the old ones, right? Every single one of them is either neutral or negative rated on Steam. So it was Forsaken before getting vaulted. But they cost the same as an actual AAA game. Because disk space or outdated engines are no problem when it comes to keeping making money. I mean, off course season passes and raids are not included.\n\nThe campaigns are great. 4 missions you must play more than once and a lot of obligatory side quests. 4 whole hours worth of content. Reused enemies since D1, same bosses returning as ""nightmares"" or getting ""unfrozen"". ""New"" weapons from D1 or reused models with a new fancy name.

Ok, maybe not the best, but a close second after gambit and it\'s 4 great maps.\n\nI\'m OK with the content being vaulted because the money they make with the expansions, eververse and seasonal content is definitely going into improving this game. The engine is a little problematic, but they didn\'t have time to fix it in 3 years. And they can\'t just release a new game in an engine that actually works.

In fact, they can do this job better than any species. This is proven by the fact that in many scenes we can see how the place is well-rated and how many people think that this place is very good. But that's not all, because there is an interesting plot: when the orc fingers are in contact with the customer skin sometimes they inject a liquid (very similar to human sweat) which leads to the customer to have an unatoppable desire to have sex with the orc. To be honest, I think this is true for multiple reasons:\n- for the fact that when you massage your ordinary client, you won't have sex with them even if you do this a lot of times (the ordinary clients have their clothes on)\n- for the fact that when you massage the VIPs step by step they become more horny till the point of actually wanting to have sex (the VIPs sometimes leave a part of their body or their full body without clothing for a long period of time)\n- for the fact that Valerie (the Ti-girl) often when you do your job perfectly says 'Was that really just a massage?' referring to how strange the massage was as an experience for her in regard of a normal massage\n- for the fact that training once with the equipments you bought makes a big difference in your massage performance with the VIPs even though, as an orc, you are very muscular since the beginning. In fact, is pretty odd that using an equipment once make you a lot more efficient (To be honest, I think this is because by working out you sweat a lot and so you can inject better the liquid in the VIPs skin)\n- for the fact that even when you complete all the progress with a VIP charachter (which happens when you unlock all the four position of that charachter) you can still message them and do whether pose you want from the four options you can choose (I think this is because the client is addicted, and so you can control them very easily and have sex with them how many times you want even after the completion of all their story)\nEnjoy :P"", '0:18 did low tier god tell someone to kill themselves?', 'If by ""too powerful"" you mean the development crawls seeing as how the last update for it was in March, then yeah.

He also, even though he hated them all, was more accepting of his God hood and playing at the same level, or a higher level, than the other gods.  He had to embrace the God part of himself to go against the others.  And he was going all out for years, for decades. But at the end of 3 he starts to realize the cost, to come to his senses a bit. He wants to let go of the rage and the need for vengeance.   We see that.  And Kratos in 2018 GOW is older and tired and has been living as a man and rejecting his God hood for who knows how long.  He hasn't even had to acknowledge it.  He actually fought against it.  In the comics he went out into the woods to test himself and try to prove he could resist the rage.  To prove that this family he could keep safe, even from himself.  But the center of that was clearly Fay.  The wife who knew it all and accepted him anyway.  I think she kept him more grounded.  But she's gone and they're being hunted and he finds himself needing to try to find that part of himself again and he struggles with it.  If his powers are weaker it's because he isn't the same driven angry vengeful God of War that he was before.  And I'm not sure he can be.

And to mention the age gap everyone's freaking about, they're only 3 years apart. The maximum age gap for any other country can range from 1-3 or possibly 5. Hence it is NOT pedophilia. Being a pedophile and being 3 years apart your lover doesn't make you a pedo at all, Those are separate things. Aside that, 10 year age gaps were normalized in the older generation and it still exists till now. However being 5 years apart is enough. People would come up with any useless reason to make this ship go down, which is just really sad. Leave Amy be, after all she was the one to save him, it's embarrassing for sonic to be in such a situation because he's a narcissistic and competitive type of person and refuses to show defeat or weakness, unfortunately. He has a hard time trying to process emotions Infront of Amy, henceforth the sonic team ( or a part of them ) did confirm that this ship is most likely going to happen. Keep in mind that they won't be having a s**ual relationship, a date means to go out for dinner with someone or to the cinema with them, nothing too corny. A relationship doesn't always have to have any ideas of s**ual activity or such, friendly kisses, cuddles and hugs are appropriate enough for their relationship. I personally feel really bad for amy and the amount of hate she's getting on a daily basis. She doesn't deserve such a thing for showing compassion, love and care for sonic.

For free damage, I roll in when he's halfway done travelling down,. \nAlso always always get the free hits in when you spawn in. When he's turning around and walking, rush towards him and get as many hits as you can. On my dual katana build, i can get about 6 or 8 hits in before he attacks, and that's huge. And for that huge three strike aoe, same as the goldbreaker, going in is a lot easier than dodging back, standing right next to him, u can land one light, dodge, one light, and maybe around 3/4 light attacks before dodging the last one, before he's vulnerable again. And for his grab, he takes about 2 seconds to wind up, so don't panic, you can get a couple hits in, then dodge inwards, because his recovery time is really long on that.\nI played this fight really similar to godfrey's, being very aggressive.\n\ni was using a STR/DEX build, with bloodhound step on the katana. \nPlaying on NG++, Level 255 (which may have made it a lot easier than it should have been), with about 90 of both STR and DEX\nFound it a lot easier to just equip a starlight shard and put all but one of my  flasks to Crimson. For the physick it helped my aggressive playstyle by putting in increased stamina and stamina recovery.\nFor those who use colossal weapons and jump attacks, like i said wait for those moments after his AOE's, and try not to get greedy due to how slow colossal weapons can be.

Like, how is it even enjoyable to bang your head against the wall for an hour against even the most intentionally-straightforward bosses bc you have to cheese bleed procs in long, drawn out battles where you can\'t make even 1 mistake bc your build makes you a 1 hit kill against every enemy? \n\nHe seems to be having fun which is all that matters, I have no interest in policing how people play. But what bothers me is that he complains about problems (or more accurately, complains about the wrong problems) when they could be solved if he didn\'t have all these concrete beliefs about the game/his build that are incorrect. For ex, he doesn\'t think weapon damage matters bc he ""can only beat these bosses by [spamming] bleed"", so there\'s ""no point in upgrading weapons, it won\'t help."" Like, dude, if you used even just some of the upgrade materials that are just wasting away in your inventory to upgrade a weapon, you wouldn\'t HAVE to spam bleed. \n\nWeapon upgrades are important. Vig is important. If you want to play without them, TOTALLY FINE. But it doesn\'t make for a very fun watch to see someone struggle for 40 minutes against a boss that isn\'t supposed to be hard and you only have to take to half HP bc they continue to ignore mechanics and gameplay systems designed to tailor the experience so you don\'t get stuck against easy bosses and the challenging ones remain challenging.

He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\n\n\n\nStrategy\n\n\n\nHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.\n\n\n\nThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.\n\n\n\nA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\n\n\n\nThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\n\n\n\nHowever, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\n\n\n\nAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\n\n\n\nIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\n\n\n\nIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.\n\n\n\nLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\n\n\n\nWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\n\n\n\nPassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\n\n\n\nDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\n\n\n\nIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\n\n\n\nFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\n\n\n\nFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\n\n\n\nThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\n\n\n\nThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\n\n\n\nA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\n\n\n\nA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\n\n\n\nThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\n\n\n\nThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\n\n\n\nA Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.\n\n\n\nPairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.\n\n\n\nThe Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.\n\n\n\nA fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.\n\n\n\nA risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough"", 'At least the music is good', ""Farting noises and trash can gongs are what's needed to revolutionize the horror game industry.""]"

He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\r\n\r\nStrategy\r\n\r\nHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.\r\n\r\nThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.\r\n\r\nA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\r\n\r\nThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\r\n\r\nHowever, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\r\n\r\nAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\r\n\r\nIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.\r\n\r\nLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\r\n\r\nWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\r\n\r\nPassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\r\n\r\nDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\r\n\r\nIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\r\n\r\nFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\r\n\r\nFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\r\n\r\nThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\r\n\r\nA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\r\n\r\nA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\r\n\r\nThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\r\n\r\nThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\r\n\r\nA Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.\r\n\r\nPairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage.

Encoded in the statues on the building, for telling WW3!*  Look at these bible scriptures as further proof, Romans1:23, Deuteronomy5:8, Romans1:25, Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18, 18:4,6,24;John the Baptist, Jesus....Roman soldiers Peirced him, not Jews  The Mark of the beast is on the shield of the Empire and on top of their buildings.  *666 is on the three level crown(vicarivs filii dei).* Germany concealing historical information about WW2 and that Nazi war on Russia, which killed more of their population than almost all other nations involved combined.  The Pope never spoke out about the atrocities, even though informed.  *The French and Bolshevik revolutions infuriated Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18, and that is why both Russia and France were attacked.  1798, the French Revolution ended the Bible\'s for told 1260 years of complete subjugation of the world, including the death penalty for observing the Sabbath (which is not (sun)day) and for Biblical festivals, like Passover(538AD was the beginning of the death decree, by Roman Consul(Emperor Justinian).*  The UK also had a secret they wanted hidden by the fog of WW2. *Turkey and Arab States are where Gog and Magog are of the Bible\'s Ezekiel 38, and surrounded by seas(Walid Shoebat), which to be driven in to as per the Bible\'s description.  Turkey is also directly north of Israel, and where the bible calls the ""seat of Satan"". Constantinople(Roman Emperor Constantine\'s city, now Istanbul, Turkey) was headquarters of Rome in the past. Rosh means head, but just because Russia sounds like the Hebrew word for head, doesn\'t mean it is the head(Rosh) of Gog and Magog.  They are not even in the same Country.  Gog Magog war comes after the 1000 years of peace on earth.* A sovereign city is under attack in Florida USA, by an American Governor Ron Desantis, for speaking about Biblical matters. *He talks how it is waking people up, and must stop.  This is war over knowing God. The US claims to believe in Democracy and has in God we trust on money, but are attacking God.*  80% of US money has been printed in the last couple years, with the stock market just better than the drop of the great depression of 1929 and still falling.  *NATO must be broken up, and is the greatest obstacle to peace in the world.  The time is quickly approaching for all nations to take control of oppressive business holdings of NATO Countries, as enemies of you and the world.*  Take away their terror production ability.  *NATO changed the name of Ukraine\'s Capital from a Russian word to some thing else. Refused to talk peace. US Senator Jim Risch on video says,""we can not let this end"", when reffering to the Ukraine war.  Stockpiles of NATO weapons were found in bunkers in Ukraine.  The evidence to invade Iraq, still has not been given, or Syria. NATO nations have military bases around the world(800+). They are masters of deception, and misdirecting anger.*  Revelation 18:6,24. *The church claims they are the new Jerusalem, and the Vatican represents God\'s temple, so the Pope is the one sitting in the (false) temple with 666 on his crown and the sign of the religion and empire in his hand(the cross).*  US Senator Lindsay Graham said that Ukraine\'s war is the US war, and that the year 2017 would be the year of offense(wow). That was before this so called invasion.  US\'s Mike Pompeo also said that the war would start in 2017.  *President Donald J. Trump said over 3 1/2 years ago that the US would soon be at war with Russia and China.*  Christian networks, behind the scenes are fomenting a war against China, using false attacks on Taiwan.  These people are totally evil. *NATO is the military arm of the beast system. (M.O.B. (cross/X) on flag). People pledge an allegiance to its supposed ideals. Bow to what the image(cross/2crossed swords of Islam/X of Rome) represents or die.  Catechism of the Catholic Church say no ""buy or sell"" or greeting to any who leaves the cross(Church). Those who don\'t accept it, have fire rain down from heaven in the sight of men.*  Remember this! No man has greater love than this, that he give his life for his friends.  *Joe Biden now says, that the weapon stockpiles in Ukraine were there preemptively for when Russia attacked Ukraine.  So when the offensive attack came that Lindsay Graham, Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump were talking about in advance. Russia entered Ukraine because weaponization in Ukraine against Russia and because of killing of so called Russian separatists and sympathizers. NATO Countries are stealing Russian assets claiming on account of the war, but it seams to be the other way around.  NATO was attacking Russians in Ukraine and militarizing for an all out assault.  The West would not negotiate with Putin to prevent the escalation.  So seaze NATO property, confiscate their money in your Country, stop their monetary transactions and send them packing.*  Do to them, what they were doing.  *Why does the Roman Empire and Church(called Roman Catholic Church) exist, when the Bible in Revelation 17,18 says it is evil and responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth?  Verse 6 of chapter 18 of Revelation says to pay her back double for what she has done to others.*  Is Donald Trump a prophet, or was he just ahead of schedule proclaiming wars with Russia and China?  *Think!*  The war with China hasn\'t even started yet, but it was Trump saying that the corona virus started in China.  *He thought he could get you to start a war through that, but it is not China spraying your cities just before outbreaks.* Look up, see spraying!  *Taiwan has no embassies, as it is not a Country, but a part of China, as openly acknowledged till recently(accept Lithuania, which is going to be used to start war on Russia and China).*  Trump authorized ""operation warp speed"" to force vaccinate by military force.  He authorized death by poison gas, electrocution and firing squad to the already authorized lethal injection. *America you are fighting for your life, don\'t choose cowardice, as the world counts on you!*  The world collectively belongs to all mankind.  *It is greedy people who try to usurp the resources and control.*  All people deserve dignity and their fair share. *This is not NATO helping Ukraine, but a NATO take over of Ukraine and war on Russia. Ukraine was part of Russia.(Russian language and history being hidden).* Biden stopped 3 gas pipelines and all exploration in Alaska, but didn\'t even envite the largest electric car company to an electric vehicle fair. US future walkers?  *How many nations of the world will be attacked by an alliance that the Bible calls satanic before people realize it must be stopped?*  Revelation 18:4 ""Get out of her my people""   NATO-Rome/UK attacking Acts2:44. *Taking a righteous stand is never easy, and God says no COWARDS will inherit his Kingdom.* Research Boris Johnston\'s "" plan A"", corona virus deaths not working, WAR!  *New vaccines for new variants, with out testing and very quickly, how?*  Prince Charles was recorded hugging the Pope and congratulating him on his war.  What war?  British Royals own video. *NATO is planning to go to war with the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but Russia had no right to defend themselves from the NATO aggressors militarizing Ukraine with the goal of destroying Russia, and attacking Russian loyalists(NATO only defensive lol).* Carefully Share this information and pray for Russia and Ukraine, and *clear browser and site history!*    Sweden/Finland extremely militarized with M.O.B. on equipment and on Russia\'s border. *Think!  Remember the German Nazis?*  German tanks in Ukraine and Lithuania.  *When media disallows commenting is because of deception.  Unbiased media that hides opinions(how can that be possible?)*  2400+ Nazis(Nazi tattoos) surrender to Russia in Ukraine.  *NATO is headed for a trap that they will not be able to get out of. US President admits, behind the NATO proxy war. Unless the US people stop what is happening, get out of the US, get out of the US!*  Roman Catholic Joe Biden is making moves, like Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler.  *Rome and cronies attacking businesses and products.* Think!  Corona/monkey pox(they\'re changing the name)/leopard pox/*heat lockdowns* about to arrive world wide compliments of Rome/UK. *UK saying the culling of ALL domestic animals coming(Pharaoh like control, bow or die).*  2 US billionaires say US dollar collapse and civil war coming. *(G7 ban Russian gold to prop up their fiat currencies, based on faith, but not faith in God, 2Corinthians4:4)*  The great reset before being hijacked by Nazi billionaires was that every man will have property including his own fig tree and grape vines(obviously a dwelling), which became the you won\'t own any thing and you\'ll be happy.  *These are the guys attacking Russia and Ukraine(like WW2).* \n Stallenburg admits NATO was providing Ukraine heavy weapons for a long time(NATO, defensive?). *Bitcoin=gold backed decentralized, Church/State digital currency=faith backed, centralized/enslavement 2023.* The UK imported a king from Germany @WW2 to marry the British Queen and take her last name, fooling the masses. *WW3=WW2=Rome\'s war on Acts2:44. Select, copy, paste, email and print, and repeat.* NATO has Russian weapons. *Leaders of Ukraine military, foreign.  The war was going to be a distraction from the G7 digital dollar of 2014, 2017, but failed to arrive then, but will arrive 2023. Russian gold banned, to protect fiat $. I\'m not Russian, so quit attacking them!  Rome starting WW3 to hide exposé.  *WW1=WWincome tax, think!* Angola, Japan = Rome. NATO now sinking ships preemptively.(Thought Police/executioner) Wow NATO defensive? Europe using fires to push WW3 agenda against Acts2:44.

You score ONE run per player successfully circling the bases through play.\n\nCricket: Score ""runs"" (plural) by hitting a ball into fair territory until the ball is successfully returned by the opposing team to the wickets and the runners ""run out."" In cricket, there are two batsmen/wickets (but one being bowled to) and if the batsman successfully strikes the ball, the two run between the wickets for as long as it takes for the ball to come back.\n\nObviously there\'s a lot more at play and this is an extremely simplified comparison, but the general idea still applies, I believe.']"

When somebody is using both hands to grasp you, the weakest point in the grip is where their thumb meets their index finger. By tugging once as hard as you can at that point with both your arms, its not too hard to pull out of their grasp. Then you run like hell. You should honestly never fight somebody unless you have absolutely no other choice. \n\nSo you know, this works with a single hand grip as well. Tug out from where the thumb meets the index finger.\nTo be clear, most of what this dude teaches is bullshit, and this is used only in the scenario that you are running away, but are not in immediate danger. He failed to elaborate this.\n\n In some cases, it would be better to repeatedly attack the the face of your assailant so that they let go, before kicking straight outwards and running away. Generally, this maneuver is used against somebody who isn't immediately trying to take you somewhere or hurt you, but is trying to intimidate you. \n\nIf you need to make sure that the person attacking you doesn't give chase, one of the first things taught in krav is to be extraordinarily aggressive when attacking. It's off-putting to most untrained people, and will cause them to panic. You would use your non-dominant arm to make a physical barrier on their shoulder, and attempt to control the arm that would present an immediate threat with whichever one of your arms is stronger. The shoulder you want to shove in to is on the same side of the arm you attempt to control (Otherwise you would just be hugging the guy). You would do this all while shoving forward and using your knees and shin to beat the stuffing out of their groin (with kicks) and solar plexus (knees). Priority number one is making sure that you can run away, so as soon as the opportunity arises- you do it.\n\nA real fight is messy, and grappling like that wont always go how you think it will. You just need to have the same motions ingrained into you so that  even when things do go wrong, you know what to do.\n\nGuys, I would like to mention one more thing. This is meant to be entirely informative, and you should never try something you read on the internet without having trained extensively to make sure you know what you're doing. One thing you SHOULD do is avoid the three S's\nStupid places\nStupid times\nStupid people.\nAnd if you fail to do that, and it looks like a scrap is about to break out?
